 deep-learning introduction:
 1.deep learning is defines about working on comple neural networks.this topic is subset of the machine learning.
 types of layers in deep learning:
 1.input layer: 
 recieves the raw data to machine
 
 2.hidden layer: 
perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data

 3.output layer:
 provide the final output and prediction on classification

ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS IN DEEP LEARNING:

1.ReLU: rectified liner unit:
which is used to the hidden layer to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.
2.sigmoid:
map the values binary(0 and 1 in the layer).
3.softmax:
convert the raw data in to (score)convert into probability on the givendata
